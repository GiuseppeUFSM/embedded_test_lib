# Blink Led Demo

When we start programming in microcontrollers, the most basic code we do is a blink led. It's a "hello world" for microcontroller!
So, the first example here also tests a production code which blinks a led. The double here is playing the role of a led.

## Firmwares
DUT: [micropython original firmware](http://micropython.org/download#esp32).

DOUBLE: [micropython original firmware](http://micropython.org/download#esp32).

## How to run it:
``` 
python3 test_blink_led.py -v
``` 

## Electrical Connections
